## v2.0.0 (2019-02-24)

* provide Arp_packet.size
* Arp_handler API changes: return Arp_packet.t instead of Cstruct.t
* adapt to ethernet 2.0.0 changes

## v1.0.0 (2019-02-02)

* split opam package into two separate ones: a core
  `arp` package and the `arp-mirage` implementation
  for MirageOS that has more dependencies.  This
  eliminates the use of depopts that was done previously
  to build the Mirage layer. (#7 @avsm)

* port build system to Dune (#7 @avsm). The `make coverage`
  and `make bench` targets will do the job of the previous
  topkg targets for those.

* minor fixes to ocamldoc comments to be compatible with
  odoc.

* use mirage-random and mirage-random-test instead of a
  nocrypto dependency in tests and bench (#7 @hannesm)

* import tests from mirage-tcpip (#8 @hannesm)

* depend on the ethernet opam package, no longer provided
  by tcpip >3.7.0 (#9 @hannesm)

* Don't ship with -warn-error +A, use it only in `./build`
